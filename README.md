# Podcast Summarizer üéô

**Podcast Summarizer** is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload podcast audio or video file and get a summarized version of the content. The app uses OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription and Google's Gemini API (via LangChain) for generating concise summaries in Roman English. The summary is displayed in a clean and user-friendly interface, with the transcription and summary neatly organized for easy reading.
